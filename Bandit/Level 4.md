Notes:

In Linux, the `-a` flag used with the `ls` command stands for "all." When you run `ls -a`, it instructs the `ls` command to list all files and directories, including hidden ones, in the specified directory.

In Linux and Unix-like operating systems, hidden files and directories are those whose names start with a dot (`.`). These files and directories are typically configuration files or directories that contain settings or data used by various applications and the system itself. By default, the `ls` command does not display hidden files and directories in the listing.

So, when you use `ls -a`, it displays a comprehensive list of all files and directories in the specified location, including both visible and hidden ones. This can be useful when you need to see all the contents of a directory, including those that are typically hidden from view.
