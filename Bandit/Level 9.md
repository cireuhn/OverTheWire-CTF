Notes:  
`Sort` - command is a powerful Linux command that is used to sort lines of text in a file or stream. It has various options and features that allow you to fine-tune the sorting process, including sorting the text in a file according to the values in a specific column, changing the sort order, and more.

The basic syntax for the sort command is as follows:

sort [options] [files]

By default, the sort command sorts lines of text in ascending order based on the text itself. For example, if you have a file with the following content:
```
this
is
an
example
of
sort
```
When you use the sort command without any options, it will output the sorted text as follows:

```
an
example
is
of
sort
this
```  
`Uniq` - uniq command is a Linux command used to identify and display unique lines in a file or stream. The basic syntax for the command is as follows:

uniq [options] [files]  
By default, the uniq command displays all unique lines (i.e., lines that appear exactly once in the input). You can use the -c or --count switch to display the count of each unique line, like this:
```
cat
dog
cat
bird
dog
bird
```  
Using the uniq -c command will output:  
```
2 cat
2 dog
1 bird
```  
Additionally, the uniq command has other useful options, such as:

`-u` or --unique: Displays only unique lines (the default behavior if no options are specified).  
`-i` or --ignore-case: Ignores case while comparing lines.  
`-s` or --skip-fields: Skips a certain number of leading fields when comparing lines.  
`-w` or --width: Sets the width of fields to compare.
